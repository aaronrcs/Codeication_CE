# Codeication_CE
"Codeication"-> Chrome Extension:


I created a Chrome Extension called "Codeication" that allows programmers to choose how long they want to tackle programming activites or problems. Because sometimes programmers get stubborn and choose not to take breaks and code for endless hours. Thus, this extension will allow a user to choose a time, once that time is over, depending on what website they're on, all text in that website will be replaced with the word "Take a break".
